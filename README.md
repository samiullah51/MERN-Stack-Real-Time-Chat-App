# Real-Time-Chat-Application using React/Redux + NodeJS/Express + MongoDB
## Description
This is a real time chat application built in react.JS/redux, node.Js and Socket.IO. A user can register and find all the memebers using this chat. If any user want to chat with another user 
of this application, he/she can simply add him/her to his conversation sections just by clicking on a single user. After adding a user to the conversation section, he/she can 
start real time chating with him/her.
## Frontend Technologies
I have used one of the most popular framework React.JS as a frontend. For the state management I have used redux.
## Backend Technologies
I have used Node.JS as a backend. Instead if Node.JS, I prefered Express.JS which is the node.JS framework to handle API's easily as compared to pure Node.JS. JWT(Json Web Token)
is used for authentication.

## Database
MongoDB is used as a database for this application.
